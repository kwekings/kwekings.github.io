I can supervise undergraduate and Masters by coursework student research projects under programmes by the Department of Biological Sciences at the National University of Singapore. The majority of research opportunities with me will be tied to my work coordinating NParks’ Tropical Forest Ecology Research programme, and especially contributing to the anchor projects on the programme, such as the Long Term Forest Ecological Monitoring (LTFEM) project (see [Er et al. (2023)](/publications.html#ErEtAl_2023)).

Prospective students must be interested in the projects on offer and be willing to work very hard. I offer projects with research questions that I think are meaningful enough to have a chance at publication in a scientific journal, but this is only possible if data quality is sufficiently high, which very much depends on the student carrying out the study. On my part, a lot of time and effort goes into working with the student to develop a robust study design and coaching on how to make sense of data and communicate the work; on the part of the student, the data collection must be meticulous and the sample size must be sufficient. In return, the student will witness (the pains of) science-in-action at first hand and may eventually have the satisfaction of seeing his or her results published (see my track record).

I also require the student to be receptive to criticism.

Feel free to approach any of my former students to find out what to expect from me. If you think you might be able to take it and possess the requisites, please get in touch to arrange a face-to-face chat. However, meeting up does not mean acceptance.

## 1.	Mortality and growth rates during the thinning phase of forest succession

This project will undertake a re-survey of the 'Mandai storm forest’ plots. See [Yee et al. (2019)](/publications.html#YeeEtAl_2019) and [Lai et al. (2022)](/publications.html#HughTanSpecial_LaiEtAl) for more information on these plots. In brief, there are 40 plots measuring 10 x 10 m north and south of Mandai road that were surveyed annually from 2011--2015 and then once in 2023. The research objective is to estimate mortality and growth rates of saplings (1 – 5 cm DBH) >10 years after the original tree fall event 15 years ago.

This project is more suitable as a FYP (i.e., LSM4288).

## 2.	Comparing sapling communities between native- and exotic-dominated forests in Singapore

This project will establish 10 x 10 m ‘sub-plots’ in one corner of each plot that we have in the Bukit Batok Nature Park, Bukit Batok Town Park, Thomson Nature Park, and Windsor Nature Park, and measure the stems 1 – 5 cm DBH, i.e., saplings. We have five plots in each of these four parks (i.e., total of 20 plots) where the trees >5 cm DBH in 20 x 20 m have already been measured, and are predominantly non-native (i.e., exotic) tree species. See [Neo et al. (2017)](/publications.html#NeoEtAl_2017) and [Lai et al. (2021)](/publications.html#LaiEtAl_2021). The sapling communities in these plots will be compared to that of 33 similar sub-plots that have been established in the native-dominated 'Wong Yew Kwan plots' in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve.

This project is more suitable as a two-semester UROPS (i.e., LSM3288+LSM3289).
